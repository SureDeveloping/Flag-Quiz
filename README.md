### Features

The website is a Flag Quiz. Visitors can test their knowledge of countries and their flags. There are 3 main pages. The landing page provides an overview of all the content on the site for the visitor. The second page is the "How to play" page, which explains the rules.  The third page is the game page where the quiz is played.

- Landing Page:
There is a heading at the top of the landing page. The Flag Quiz.  Below it is a picture of the flags of the world. Followed by two buttons. The first opens a Page which is showing the rules of the game and the second starts the game. There is visual feedback when the mouse is moved over the button. 

- How to Play Page:
Open is an overview of how to play on the website. Below is the text with the rules.
Below this text are two clickable buttons. The first takes you back to the main page. A click on the second button will start the game.

- Game Page:
At the top of the game page is the scoreboard. It shows how many correct questions the player has answered. Below this, the graphic of a landing position is displayed. Followed by the question. Which country does this flag belong to? This is followed by the possible answers and two further buttons. Next Question and Quit. Quit always takes the user directly back to the landing page. With Next question he can skip a question or open the next question after he has answered a question. If the player has clicked on the button with the correct answer. This is indicated by changing the color of the button. If he has clicked an incorrect answer, the color of the button also changes. The wrong answer turns red, the correct answer yellow.

### Accessibility

To ensure Accessibility the following things were done:
- I used semantic HTML
-### I used descriptive alt attributes for images
-### I provided information for screen readers
- I used good color contrast and a tested color palette

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS and Java Script were used for this project.

### Software Used

Balsamiq - To create a wireframe
Gitpod - To code the website
Git - For version control
Github - To store and deploy the website
Google Fonts - All fonts used are from google fonts
Font Awesome - All icons used are from Font Awesome
gauger.io/fonticon - To create a favicon 
Google Dev Tools, and Lighthouse - For troubleshooting testing and fixing bugs
Deepl - For translating text

Am I Responsive? To check if the page is responsive

## Deployment

The project was codes with gipod and then deployed on Github. That is how the deployment was done:
- I loged in at GitHub and navtigate to the repo of the project
- I clicked on Settings and navigated to "Github pages"
- There I seted the source of Deploy from a branch and set the branch from none to main and clicked save.
- Then this link was deployed automatically: https://suredeveloping.github.io/flag-quiz/

## Testing

The page was tested on different ways and different errors came to light.

### Manual Testing

I tested all the links and the Form. This was done during the hole prozess. This was done repeatedly throughout the project. A detailed description of the bugs can be found in solved and unsolved bugs.

### Chrom Developer Tools

- I used Def-tolls to check if the side is working on different screen sizes.
- I used Lighthouse to test my webside. 

This opimisation I did afterwards:
- I comprimised the pictures.
- Image of the Lighthouse test result:
